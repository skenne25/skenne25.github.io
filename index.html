       Basic Bird Information
       </h4><p> Birds are more than just the pigeon or crow we see on our morning commute. There are over 10,000 species of birds in existence! This roughly translates into nearly 400 billion birds on the planet. But birds didn't always look the way we see them now. </p>
 <p> It took them quite a while to evolve into their flying feathered selves - about 160 million years. Fossils of birds and bird ancestors (dinosaurs) have been dated as far back as 66 million years ago.<br>Fossil dating and progression shows the evolution of certain dinosaurs into the creatures we know today. </p>

    <h4> Most Common Birds</h4>
    <p>
    Mourning Doves and Northern Cardinals are some of the most common birds in North America. Pest birds, like pigeons, seem to beat these two species in population size because pigeons prefer urban settings much more than Mourning Doves and Northern Cardinals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internationally, such as in Europe, birds like the Common Blackbird and Common Starling are seen more frequently. Europe is home to several recognizable birds we see in North America, but some may be non-native to us. The pigeon, a rock dove, is a notorious bird that is native to Europe but also seen around the world.

     Birds are more diverse than we realize. They outnumber people and continue to multiply. Their diversity allows them to thrive in several types of climates and migrate to areas they are not native to.</p>
